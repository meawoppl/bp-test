iCE40 Hardware Checklist
Technical Note



1. Introduction
When designing complex hardware using the iCE40™ device family (iCE40 LP/HX, iCE40LM, iCE40 Ultra™, iCE40 UltraLite™,
iCE40 UltraPlus™), you must pay special attention to critical hardware configuration requirements. This technical note steps
through these critical hardware requirements related to the iCE40 device. This document does not provide detailed step-
by-step instructions but gives a high-level summary checklist to assist in the design process.
Hardware checklists are developed after evaluation boards and incorporate optimized designs that improve upon the
circuitry of the evaluation boards. If you copy circuits from evaluation boards, ensure to optimize your designs according to
the hardware checklists.
The iCE40 ultra-low-power, non-volatile devices are available in four versions – the LP series for low-power applications, the
HX series for high-performance applications, and the LM and Ultra/UltraLite/UltraPlus series for ultra-low-power mobile
applications.
This technical note assumes that you are familiar with the iCE40 device features as described in the following documents:
• iCE40LP/HX Family Data Sheet (FPGA-DS-02029)
• iCE40LM Family Data Sheet (FPGA-DS-02043)
• iCE40 Ultra Family Data Sheet (FPGA-DS-02028)
• iCE40 UltraLite Family Data Sheet (FPGA-DS-02027)
• iCE40 UltraPlus Family Data Sheet (FPGA-DS-02008)
This technical note covers the following critical hardware areas:
• Power supplies as they relate to the supply rails and how to connect them to the PCB and the associated system.
• Configuration and how to connect to the configuration mode selection.
• Device I/O interface and critical signals.

2. Power Supply
The VCC (core supply voltage), VCCIO_2, SPI_VCC and VPP_2.5 V determine the iCE40 device’s stable condition. These supplies
need to be at a valid and stable level before the device can become operational. Refer to the family data sheets for voltage
requirements.
To evenly balance the stress in the solder joints, Lattice recommends that PCB solder pads match the corresponding package
solder pad type and dimensions. If a different PCB solder pad type is used, the recommended pad dimension is based on an
equivalent surface contact area.
Table 2.1. Power Supply Description and Voltage Levels

Notes:
1. iCE40LM device family do not have VPP_2.5 V and VPP_FAST supplies.
2. iCE40 Ultra/iCE40 UltraLite/iCE40 UltraPlus device families do not have VPP_FAST.
3. VPP_2.5 V can optionally be connected to a 1.8 V (±5%) power supply in Target SPI configuration modes subject to the condition that none of the
     HFOSC/LFOSC and RGB LED driver features are used. Otherwise, VPP_2.5 V must be connected to a power supply with a minimum 2.3 V level.
4. Use VPP_FAST only for fast production programming, and leave it floating or unconnected in applications.
5. For CM36 and CM49 packages, if the user does not use the NVCM fast programming function, connect the VPP_FAST pin to VCCIO_0_1 to ensure I/O
     bank 1 functions properly.
6. VCCPLL must be tied to VCC when PLL is not used.
7. External power supply filter required for VCCPLL and GNDPLL.



2.1.          Recommended Power Filtering Groups and Components
It is recommended to add filters to every power rail of iCE40 devices. Reliable filters enhance the overall performance of
the system. Table 2.2 shows the recommended filter group.

2.2.        Analog Power Supply Filter for PLL
The iCE40 sysCLOCK™ PLL contains analog blocks, so the PLL requires a separate power and ground that is quiet and stable
to reduce the output clock jitter of the PLL on the device with external VCCPLL supply pins.
Note: PLL is not offered in some device/package combinations without the VCCPLL ball. Refer to the data sheet and the
device family Pin List to check the availability of the VCCPLL ball.
The sysCLOCK PLL has the DC ground connection made on the FPGA, so the external PLL ground connection (GNDPLL) must
NOT be connected to the board’s ground except when a particular iCE40 device does not have a dedicated GNDPLL ball.


2.3.        Power-Up Sequence
It is recommended to bring up the voltage in the order described in this section. Note that there is no specified timing delay
between the power supplies, however, there is a requirement for each supply to reach a level of 0.5 V or higher before any
subsequent power supplies in the sequence are applied.
To bring up the voltage, follow these steps:
1.     Apply the VCC and VCCPLLx rails. These rails can come from the same source and must comply with the power supply
       filtering requirements. VCC is responsible for powering the core logic, while VCCPLLx is responsible for powering the
       internal clock circuitry.
2.     Apply the SPI_VCC rail. This rail is responsible for powering the SPI logic circuit used for the NVCM or external flash.
3.     Apply the VPP_2.5 V rail. This rail is responsible for powering NVCM.
4.     Other supplies (VCCIOx) do not affect device power-up functionality. Apply these supplies at any time after VCC and VCCPLLx.
When powering iCE40 device rails with the same potential, it is recommended to use the same regulator to help meet
power sequencing.
As an example, VCC and VCCPLL are tied together and should still be the first ones to be powered up. Then, if VCCIO0, VCCIO2, and
SPI_VCC are tied, then it should be the next to be applied with power since SPI_VCC should be the next in the sequence.
Then, lastly, VPP_2.5 V to be applied with power.
There is no power-down sequence required. However, when partial power supplies are powered down, it is required that
the above sequence be followed when these supplies are powered up again.
For more information, refer to the Power-Up Supply Sequence section of the iCE40 device data sheet.


2.4.        Power Source
It is recommended that the voltage regulators be accurate to within 3% of the optimum voltage to allow power noise
design margin.
When calculating the voltage regulator’s total tolerance, include:
• Regulator voltage reference tolerance
• Regulator line tolerance
• Regulator load tolerance
• Tolerances of any resistors connected to the regulator’s feedback pin that sets the regulator’s output voltage
With a 3% tolerance allocated to the voltage source, the design has a remaining 2% tolerance for noise and layout-related
issues. The 1.2 V rail is especially sensitive to noise, as every 12 mV is 1% of the rail voltage. For PLLs, target less than 0.25%
peak noise.

iCE40 Hardware Checklist
Technical Note



3. Configuration Considerations
The iCE40 LP/HX/Ultra/UltraLite/UltraPlus devices contain two types of memory, CRAM (Configuration RAM) and NVCM
(Non-volatile Configuration Memory). The iCE40LM device contains only the CRAM. CRAM memory contains the active
configuration. The NVCM provides on-chip storage of configuration data. It is one-time programmable and is recommended
for mass production.
For more information, refer to the iCE40 Programming and Configuration (FPGA-TN-02001).
The configuration and programming of the iCE40 LP/HX/LM/Ultra/UltraLite/UltraPlus devices from external memory uses
the SPI port, both in Controller and Target modes. In Controller SPI mode, the device configures its CRAM from an external
SPI flash connected to it. In Target mode, the device can be configured or programmed using the Lattice Diamond™
Programmer or embedded processor and the Lattice Radiant™ Programmer for iCE40 UltraPlus devices.
On the iCE40LP/HX and iCE40 Ultra/UltraLite/UltraPlus device families, the SPI_SS_B determines if the iCE40 CRAM is
configured from an external SPI (SPI_SS_B=0) or from the NVCM (SPI_SS_B=1). This pin is sampled after Power-on-Reset
(POR) is released or CRESET_B is held low and then goes high.

A typical connection from a host programmer to an iCE40 device with external flash is shown in Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2.
When programming the external flash, HOST CS is connected to both the CS pins of the flash and the iCE40 device with a
10 kΩ pull-up. Drive CRESET_B is low while programming the external flash. The Host Programmer will be communicating
with the external flash in this configuration, and upon normal operation, the iCE40 device will be fetching data from the
external flash for proper bootup and operation.

iCE40 Hardware Checklist
Technical Note


To program the iCE40 device in Target mode (CRAM or NVCM), connect the device as shown in Figure 3.2. The HOST CS is
only connected to the iCE40 device without a 10 kΩ pull-up, and the HOST must ensure pin CS is LOW to activate the Target
SPI configuration. Notice that connections of MOSI and MISO are interchanged during the configuration at NVCM, revert to
the original connection, including flash CS, for normal operation.
For ease of prototype programming and debugging, it is recommended that every PCB has easy access to the signals
described in Table 3.1.
Route these signals to a 2.54 mm pitch header to allow easy connection to the Lattice Programming Cable.
If space is limited, other routing options include:
• Smaller pitch header(s)
• Test points for soldering connection wires
• A high-density connector that mates to a break-out board or cable

3.1.     SPI Flash Requirement in Controller SPI Mode
You are free to select any industry-standard SPI flash. The SPI flash must support the 0x0B Fast Read command, using a
24-bit start address with eight dummy bits before the PROM provides the first data. For more information, refer to iCE40
Programming and Configuration (FPGA-TN-02001).

iCE40 Hardware Checklist
Technical Note



4. Clock Inputs
The iCE40 device provides certain pins for use as clock inputs, as described in Figure 4.1. These shared pins can be used
alternately for general-purpose I/O. For the global clock requirements, refer to the External Switching Characteristics
section of the iCE40 device family data sheet.
When these pins are used for clocking purposes, you need to pay attention to minimize signal noise on these pins. For more
information, refer to the iCE40 sysCLOCK PLL Design User Guide (FPGA-TN-02052).

LVDS and Sub-LVDS inputs require external termination resistors for proper operation, as shown in Figure 6.1. A
termination resistor (RT) between the positive and negative inputs at the receiver forms a current loop. The current across
this resistor generates the voltage detected by the receiver’s differential input comparator.
LVDS and Sub-VLDS outputs require an external resistor network consisting of two series resistors (RS) and a parallel
resistor (RP). This resistor network adjusts the FPGA’s output driver to provide the necessary current and voltage
characteristics required by the specification.
For more information on the computation for RS and RP, refer to the LVDS and Sub-LVDS Termination section of Using
Differential I/O (LVDS, Sub-LVDS) in iCE40 LP/HX Devices (FPGA-TN-02213).

7. Layout Recommendations
A good schematic design should translate into a good layout that works without any issues with noise or power distribution.
The following lists some general recommendations for layouts:
1.     All power should come from power planes to ensure good power delivery and thermal stability.
2.     Each power pin has its own decoupling capacitor, typically 100 nF, that should be placed as close as possible to each
       other.
3.     The placement of analog circuits must be away from digital circuits or high-switching components.
4.     High-speed signals should have a clearance of five times the trace width of other signals.
5.     High-speed signals that transition from one layer to another should have a corresponding transition ground if both
       reference planes are grounded. If the reference on the other layer is a VCC plane, then a stitching capacitor should be
       used (ground to VCC). Refer to Figure 7.1.




                                                                  Figure 7.1. Ground Vias Implementation




                                                                 Figure 7.2. Stitching Vias Implementation

6.     High-speed signals have a corresponding impedance requirement, calculate the necessary trace width and trace gap
       (differential gap) according to the desired stack-up. Verify trace dimensions with the PCB vendor.
7.     For differential pairs, match the length as closely as possible. A good rule of thumb is to match up to ±5 mils.


For more information on layout recommendations, refer to the following documents:
• PCB Layout Recommendations for BGA Packages (FPGA-TN-02024)
• PCB Layout Recommendations for Leaded Packages (FPGA-TN-02160)
