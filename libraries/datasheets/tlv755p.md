(1)          Operation outside the Absolute Maximum Ratings may cause permanent device damage. Absolute Maximum Ratings do not imply
             functional operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those listed under Recommended Operating Conditions.
             If used outside the Recommended Operating Conditions but within the Absolute Maximum Ratings, the device may not be fully
             functional, and this may affect device reliability, functionality, performance, and shorten the device lifetime.
(2)          The absolute maximum rating is VIN + 0.3 V or 6.0 V, whichever is smaller.

(1)          JEDEC document JEP155 states that 500V HBM allows safe manufacturing with a standard ESD control process. Manufacturing with
             less than 500V HBM is possible with the necessary precautions.
(2)          JEDEC document JEP157 states that 250V CDM allows safe manufacturing with a standard ESD control process. Manufacturing with
             less than 250V CDM is possible with the necessary precautions.

6.3 Feature Description
6.3.1 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)
An undervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuit disables the output until the input voltage is greater than the rising UVLO
voltage (VUVLO). This circuit makes sure the device does not exhibit unpredictable behavior when the supply
voltage is lower than the operational range of the internal circuitry. When VIN is less than VUVLO, the output is
connected to ground with a 120Ω pulldown resistor.
6.3.2 Enable (EN)
The enable pin (EN) is active high. Enable the device by forcing the EN pin to exceed VHI. Turn off the device by
forcing the EN pin below VLO. If shutdown capability is not required, connect EN to IN.
The device has an internal pulldown that connects a 120Ω resistor to ground when the device is disabled. The
discharge time after disabling depends on the output capacitance (COUT) and the load resistance (RL) in parallel
with the 120Ω pulldown resistor. Equation 1 calculates the time constant τ:

          120 · RL
     t=              · COUT
          120 + RL                                                                                                          (1)

www.ti.com                                                                   SBVS320D – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2024


The EN pin is independent of the input pin (IN), but if the EN pin is driven to a higher voltage than VIN, the
current into the EN pin increases. This effect is illustrated in Figure 5-23. When the EN voltage is higher than
the input voltage there is an increased current flow into the EN pin. If this increased flow causes problems in
the application, sequence the EN pin after VIN is high, or to tie EN to VIN to prevent this flow increase from
happening. If EN is driven to a higher voltage than VIN, limit the frequency on EN to below 10kHz.
6.3.3 Internal Foldback Current Limit
The TLV755P has an internal current limit that protects the regulator during fault conditions. The current limit
is a hybrid scheme with brick wall until the output voltage is less than 0.4V × VOUT(NOM). When the voltage
drops below 0.4V × VOUT(NOM), a foldback current limit is implemented that scales back the current as the output
voltage approaches GND. When the output shorts, the LDO supplies a typical current of ISC. The output voltage
is not regulated when the device is in current limit. In this condition, the output voltage is the product of the
regulated current and the load resistance. When the device output shorts, the PMOS pass transistor dissipates
power [(VIN – VOUT) × ISC] until thermal shutdown is triggered and the device turns off. After the device cools
down, the internal thermal shutdown circuit turns the device back on. If the fault condition continues, the device
cycles between current limit and thermal shutdown.
The foldback current-limit circuit limits the current that is allowed through the device to current levels lower than
the minimum current limit at nominal VOUT current limit (ICL) during start-up. See Figure 5-26 for typical current
limit values. If the output is loaded by a constant-current load during start-up, or if the output voltage is negative
when the device is enabled, then the load current demanded by the load potentially exceeds the foldback current
limit and the device does not rise to the full output voltage. For constant-current loads, disable the output load
until the output rises to the nominal voltage.
Excess inductance causes the current limit to oscillate. Minimize the inductance to keep the current limit from
oscillating during a fault condition.
6.3.4 Thermal Shutdown
Thermal shutdown protection disables the output when the junction temperature rises to approximately 165°C.
Disabling the device eliminates the power dissipated by the device, allowing the device to cool. When the
junction temperature cools to approximately 155°C, the output circuitry is enabled again. Depending on power
dissipation, thermal resistance, and ambient temperature, the thermal protection circuit cycles on and off. This
cycling limits regulator dissipation that protects the circuit from damage as a result of overheating.
Activating the thermal shutdown feature typically indicates excessive power dissipation as a result of the product
of the (VIN – VOUT) voltage and the load current. For reliable operation, limit junction temperature to a maximum
of 125°C. To estimate the margin of safety in a complete design, increase the ambient temperature until the
thermal protection is triggered; use worst-case loads and signal conditions.
The internal protection circuitry protects against overload conditions but is not intended to be activated in normal
operation. Continuously running the device into thermal shutdown degrades device reliability.

(1)    Make sure all table conditions are met.
(2)    The device is disabled when any condition is met.
6.4.1 Normal Operation
The device regulates to the nominal output voltage when all of the following conditions are met.
•     The input voltage is greater than the nominal output voltage plus the dropout voltage (VOUT(NOM) + VDO)
•     The enable voltage has previously exceeded the enable rising threshold voltage and has not decreased
      below the enable falling threshold
•     The output current is less than the current limit (IOUT < ICL)
•     The device junction temperature is less than the thermal shutdown temperature (TJ < TSD)
6.4.2 Dropout Operation
If the input voltage is lower than the nominal output voltage plus the specified dropout voltage, but all other
conditions are met for normal operation, the device operates in dropout. In this mode, the output voltage
tracks the input voltage. During this mode, the transient performance of the device degrades because the pass
transistor is in a triode state and no longer controls the output voltage of the LDO. Line or load transients in
dropout result in large output voltage deviations.
When the device is in a steady dropout state (defined as when the device is in dropout, VIN < VOUT(NOM) +
VDO, right after being in a normal regulation state, but not during start-up), the pass transistor is driven as hard
as possible when the control loop is out of balance. During the normal time required for the device to regain
regulation, VIN ≥ VOUT(NOM) + VDO, VOUT overshoots VOUT(NOM) during fast transients.
6.4.3 Disabled
The output is shut down by forcing the enable pin below VLO. When disabled, the pass transistor is turned off,
internal circuits are shut down, and the output voltage is actively discharged to ground by an internal switch from
the output to ground. The active pulldown is on when sufficient input voltage is provided.

7 Application and Implementation
                                                             Note
       Information in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification,
       and TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for
       determining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design
       implementation to confirm system functionality.

7.1 Application Information
7.1.1 Input and Output Capacitor Selection
The TLV755P requires an output capacitance of 0.47µF or larger for stability. Use X5R- and X7R-type
ceramic capacitors because these capacitors have minimal variation in capacitance value and equivalent series
resistance (ESR) over temperature. When selecting a capacitor for a specific application, consider the DC bias
characteristics for the capacitor. Higher output voltages cause a significant derating of the capacitor. Generally,
derate ceramic capacitors by 50%. For best performance, use a maximum output capacitance value of 200µF.
Place a 1µF or greater capacitor on the input pin of the LDO. Some input supplies have a high impedance.
Placing a capacitor on the input supply reduces the input impedance. The input capacitor counteracts reactive
input sources and improves transient response and PSRR. If the input supply has a high impedance over a large
range of frequencies, several input capacitors are used in parallel to lower the impedance over frequency. Use
a higher-value capacitor if large, fast, rise-time load transients are expected, or if the device is located several
inches from the input power source.
7.1.2 Dropout Voltage
The TLV755P uses a PMOS pass transistor to achieve low dropout. When (VIN – VOUT) is less than the dropout
voltage (VDO), the PMOS pass transistor is in the linear region of operation and the input-to-output resistance
is the RDS(ON) of the PMOS pass transistor. VDO scales linearly with the output current because the PMOS
transistor functions like a resistor in dropout mode. As with any linear regulator, PSRR and transient response
degrade as (VIN – VOUT) approaches dropout operation. See Figure 5-13 and Figure 5-14 for typical dropout
values.
7.1.3 Exiting Dropout
Some applications have transients that place the LDO into dropout, such as slower ramps on VIN during start-up.
As with other LDOs, the output overshoots on recovery from these conditions. A ramping input supply causes an
LDO to overshoot on start-up when the slew rate and voltage levels are in the correct range; see Figure 7-1. Use
an enable signal to avoid this condition.

Line transients out of dropout can also cause overshoot on the output of the regulator. These overshoots are
caused by the error amplifier having to drive the gate capacitance of the pass transistor and bring the gate
back to the correct voltage for proper regulation. Figure 7-2 illustrates what is happening internally with the gate
voltage and how overshoot is caused during operation. When the LDO is placed in dropout, the gate voltage
(VGS) is pulled all the way down to ground to give the pass transistor the lowest on-resistance as possible.
However, if a line transient occurs when the device is in dropout, the loop is not in regulation and causes the
output to overshoot until the loop responds and the output current pulls the output voltage back down into
regulation. If these transients are not acceptable, then continue to add input capacitance in the system until the
transient is slow enough to reduce the overshoot.

7.1.4 Reverse Current
As with most LDOs, excessive reverse current potentially damages this device.
Reverse current flows through the body diode on the pass transistor instead of the normal conducting channel.
At high magnitudes, this current flow degrades the long-term reliability of the device, as a result of one of the
following conditions:
• Degradation caused by electromigration
• Excessive heat dissipation
• Potential for a latch-up condition
Conditions where reverse current occur are outlined in this section, all of which exceed the absolute maximum
rating of VOUT > VIN + 0.3V:
• If the device has a large COUT and the input supply collapses with little or no load current
• The output is biased when the input supply is not established
• The output is biased above the input supply

7.1.5 Power Dissipation (PD)
Circuit reliability demands that proper consideration be given to device power dissipation, location of the circuit
on the printed circuit board (PCB), and correct sizing of the thermal plane. Make sure the PCB area around the
regulator is as free of other heat-generating devices as possible that cause added thermal stresses.
As a first-order approximation, power dissipation in the regulator depends on the input-to-output voltage
difference and load conditions. Use Equation 2 to approximate PD:

     PD = (VIN – VOUT) × IOUT                                                                                                    (2)

Minimize power dissipation to achieve greater efficiency. This minimizing process is achieved by selecting the
correct system voltage rails. Proper selection helps obtain the minimum input-to-output voltage differential. The
low dropout of the device allows for maximum efficiency across a wide range of output voltages.
The main heat-conduction path for the device is through the thermal pad on the package. As such, solder the
thermal pad to a copper pad area under the device. This pad area contains an array of plated vias that conduct
heat to inner plane areas or to a bottom-side copper plane.
The maximum allowable junction temperature (TJ) determines the maximum power dissipation for the device.
According to Equation 3, power dissipation and junction temperature are most often related by the junction-to-
ambient thermal resistance (RθJA) of the combined PCB, device package, and the temperature of the ambient air
(TA).

     TJ = TA + RθJA × PD                                                                                                         (3)

Unfortunately, this thermal resistance (RθJA) is dependent on the heat-spreading capability built into the
particular PCB design, and therefore varies according to the total copper area, copper weight, and location of
the planes. The RθJA value is only used as a relative measure of package thermal performance. RθJA is the sum
of the package junction-to-case (bottom) thermal resistance (RθJCbot) plus the thermal resistance contribution by
the PCB copper.

7.1.5.1 Estimating Junction Temperature
The JEDEC standard recommends the use of psi (Ψ) thermal metrics to estimate the junction temperatures
of the LDO when in-circuit on a typical PCB board application. These metrics are not thermal resistances, but
offer practical and relative means of estimating junction temperatures. These psi metrics are independent of the
copper-spreading area. The key thermal metrics (ΨJT and ΨJB) are used in accordance with Equation 4 and are
described in the Thermal Information table.

      YJT: TJ = TT + YJT ´ PD
      YJB: TJ = TB + YJB ´ PD                                                                                                     (4)

where:
•    PD is the power dissipated as shown in Equation 2
•    TT is the temperature at the center-top of the device package
•    TB is the PCB surface temperature measured 1mm from the device package and centered on the package
     edge

7.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure
7.2.2.1 Input Current
During normal operation, the input current to the LDO is approximately equal to the output current of the LDO.
During start-up, the input current is higher as a result of the inrush current charging the output capacitor. Use
Equation 5 to calculate the current through the input.

                 COUT ´ dVOUT(t)                             VOUT(t)
     IOUT(t) =                     +
                       dt                                    RLOAD                                                                                               (5)

where:
•    VOUT(t) is the instantaneous output voltage of the turn-on ramp
•    dVOUT(t) / dt is the slope of the VOUT ramp
•    RLOAD is the resistive load impedance
7.2.2.2 Thermal Dissipation
Junction temperature is determined using the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance (RθJA) and the total power
dissipation (PD). Use Equation 6 to calculate the power dissipation. Multiply PD by RθJA as Equation 7 shows and
add the ambient temperature (TA) to calculate the junction temperature (TJ).

     PD = (IGND+ IOUT) × (VIN – VOUT)                                                                                                                            (6)

     TJ = RθJA × PD + TA                                                                                                                                         (7)

Calculate the maximum ambient temperature as Equation 8 shows if the (TJ(MAX)) value does not exceed 125°C.
Equation 9 calculates the maximum ambient temperature with a value of 99.95°C.

     TA(MAX) = TJ(MAX) – RθJA × PD                                                                                                                               (8)

     TA(MAX) = 125°C – 100.2°C/W × (4.3V – 3.3V) × (0.25A) = 99.95°C                                                                                             (9)

7.3 Power Supply Recommendations
Connect a low output impedance power supply directly to the IN pin of the TLV755P. If the input source is
reactive, consider using multiple input capacitors in parallel with the 1µF input capacitor to lower the input supply
impedance over frequency.

7.4 Layout
7.4.1 Layout Guidelines
•    Place input and output capacitors as close as possible to the device.
•    Use copper planes for device connections to optimize thermal performance.
•    Place thermal vias around the device to distribute the heat.
•    For packages with thermal pads, solder the thermal pad to copper to achieve best thermal resistance.
     Thermal resistance increases significantly when the thermal pad is not soldered.

8 Device and Documentation Support
8.1 Device Support
8.1.1 Device Nomenclature
                                                    Table 8-1. Device Nomenclature
           PRODUCT(1) (2)                                                           DESCRIPTION
                                       xx(x) is the nominal output voltage. For output voltages with a resolution of 100mV, two digits are used
                                       in the ordering number; otherwise, three digits are used (for example, 28 = 2.8V; 125 = 1.25V).
                                       P indicates an active output discharge feature. All members of the TLV755P family actively discharge
      TLV755xx(x)Pyyyz(M3)             the output when the device is disabled.
                                       yyy is the package designator.
                                       z is the package quantity. R is for reel (3000 pieces), T is for tape (250 pieces).
                                       M3 is a suffix designator for devices that only use the latest manufacturing flow.

8.5 Electrostatic Discharge Caution
                    This integrated circuit can be damaged by ESD. Texas Instruments recommends that all integrated circuits be handled
                    with appropriate precautions. Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures can cause damage.
                    ESD damage can range from subtle performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision integrated circuits may
                    be more susceptible to damage because very small parametric changes could cause the device not to meet its published
                    specifications.
